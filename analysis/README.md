# Analysis tools
This is a bunch of jupyter notebook.

```input.py``` need to be filled with simulations path, and name of important files.
Then any of the ipynb notebook can be ran separately for specific data analysys
## Sanity check
get data from edr file: Temperature, pressure, energy, box size etc...
## Distances
Overall distances matrix, Rgs, specific distances
## Secondary Structure
SS stability during simulation
## Salt bridge
Distances based analysis of salt bridges formation
## RMSs
RMSD from reference structre, rmsf overtime.
